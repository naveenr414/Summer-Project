# Summer-Project
A music recomendation system built off machine learning. 

## Introduction
Many of today's current music systems (Pandora, Spotify) fail to effectively play music for a variety of audiences on a 
variety of platforms. Many are inadequete for mobile or tablet devices, and feature clunky layouts. 

## About
The Summer Project (name pending) aims to combat these issues and employ a wholistic approach to music recomendation. This includes
taking things like the user's mood into account when recommending songs. 

## Progress

The process of building a recomendation system is broken down into three parts. 

1. Build a scraper to collect data to build a music library
2. Implement machine learning as to analyze patterns and give recomendations
3. Build a clean and sleek user interface via both web based and mobile applications. 

The project is currently on step one, as we are currently building a music library.
